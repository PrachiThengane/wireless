	  <p>The first portable handset made to call successfully, in 1973, was a Motorola researcher and executive Martin Cooper.
And the first commercially automated celullar network (the 1G) was launched in Japan in 1979. From then on many other countries such as Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden and then America began to invent celullar networks.
The 2G then emerged from the surface presenting the digital celullar technology which began in Finland on the GSM standard.</p>
