    <td width="60%">Asus has taken the laptop out of the office and brought it into your living room with the new <strong>NX90JQ</strong>. The NX90JQ features top-of-the-line components and technologies, providing the smoothest computing experience possible. Asus  teamed up with audio giant <strong>Bang and Olufsen</strong> to create a portable multimedia powerhouse - culminating in the speakers that have been built into the lid, rather than the chassis.<br>
      <br>
      As an all-in-one multimedia centre, the <strong>Asus NX90JQ</strong> is equipped with a stunning <strong>Full High Definition display</strong> (1920x1080) so you can take full advantage of the <strong>built-in BluRay</strong> player. It is the world's first notebook to feature two touch pads, positioned at either side of the elegant keyboard, which serve as an intuitive and enjoyable way for you to manage and play your multimedia content.<br>
      <br>
    It's not just about how it looks though, the <strong>NX90JQ</strong> has everything you can imagine under the hood, including an Intel Core i7 (Quad Core) processor, 6GB of RAM and <strong>1GB Nvidia</strong> graphics. It also sports 2x USB3.0 ports for high speed transfers from any portable devices you want to connect, not that you'll need any extra space; 2x 500GB hard drives are already inside!</td>
