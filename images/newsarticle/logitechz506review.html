    <td width="75%">If you've never truly experienced true surround sound, be it in games, movies, or even music DVDs then you'll be in for a treat with Logitech's new <strong>Z506 surround sound speakers</strong>. The Z506 speakers have a futuristic design in their elliptical shape which will complement most bedroom or office computer setups. Each of the 5 satellite speakers have both a driver and a tweeter built in, which is a slight change to the previous X-530 and X-540 models of the last few years. <br><br> 
    Setting up the speakers is a very quick and simple process, with all of the cables colour coded. From then on it's just a matter of deciding where you want them placed. The 75 watts RMS power that the <strong>Z506 speakers</strong> produce is more than enough to fill a large room, and you will be able to hear every sound from every angle in your games and 5.1 channel audio movies. <br><br>
    
    The <strong>Z506 speakers from Logitech</strong> provide awesome bang for your buck sound and you'll be overwhelmed with the sound quality they produce. <br><br>You can view all of the <a href="http://www.wireless1.com.au/Computer-Accessories/Speakers/LOGITECH-Z506-SPEAKERS-5-1.html">specs and features of the <strong>Z506 Speakers</strong> here</a>.</td>
