			<b>Easy Application </b><br />
			The overlay applies easily in just a few quick steps. Start by thoroughly cleaning your screen with the included Cleaning Wipe. Then, separate a corner of the overlay (no more than a thumbnail's length) from its backing, taking care not to touch the adhesive side. Line up the exposed part of the overlay with the top border of your screen, and slowly run the rest of the overlay across the screen. Finally, smooth the overlay onto the screen with the included smoothing card by gently pressing down on it.
