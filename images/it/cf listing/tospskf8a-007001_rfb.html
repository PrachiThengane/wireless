      <strong>Summary:</strong><br>
      <strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Full 12 months warranty</strong><br>
      <strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Refurbished from Toshiba Aust.</strong><br>
      <strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Near new, may have slight blemishes, in full working order.</strong><br>
      <strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Heavily discounted, limited stock.</strong><br>
      The  Toshiba Laptops have been fully refurbished by Toshiba Australia to the highest  possible standards. They are NOT refurbished by a 3rd party, like  some other products. They have been resealed with the manufacturers sticker on  them.<br>
      The  laptops are in full working order and carry a full 12 month warranty. Extended  warranty is available for an additional 2 years (3 years total) for peace of  mind.<br>
      As  they are refurbished stock, there may be very very minor surface marks on them  and we have inspected several units and they look like new. They have re-used  the packaging to save costs and the environment, but the contents inside are in  the highest possible condition.<br>
    Stock  is limited, so be sure to grab these computers at heavily discounted prices.</td></tr>
