<B><I>What is the LOCK code and how do I activate/deactivate it?</I></B></FONT>
<FONT FACE=ARIAL SIZE=2 COLOR=NAVY BLUE>
<P>LOCK code is used to secure the phone so that someone cannot use the phone other than the owner. Three successive unsuccessful attempts to unlock a handset will lock the handset permanently. To activate/deactivate/change, press "Menu" followed by "6". Press the "Navigation" key to the right until the desired option appears 'Enable', 'Disable', or 'Change'. Press the "Menu" key. Enter LOCK code followed by the "Menu" key. To unlock the phone once it has been turned on and lock is enabled: Enter the LOCK code followed by the "Menu". Menu will appear on bottom right hand corner of LCD.</P>

<B><I>How do I stop my mobile number being shown on outgoing calls without having to dial a block number each time?</I></B></FONT>
<P>At present there are two options to block CLI being sent: Enter 1831 before dialing number. This is suitable for blocking originators number from being sent. Contact the carrier or service provider or virtual mobile operator and ask for CLI suppression for sending only. There is no way to enable or disable number suppression via the phone for all calls.</P>

<B><I>What is a PIN number and how do I activate/deactivate it?</I></B></FONT>
<P>PIN is a Personal Identification Number, similar to the PIN on an EFTPOS card. There are two types of PIN's. PIN 1 and PIN 2. · PIN 1 is used to secure the sim card so that no one, other than the owner, has access to the services or information belonging to the card. For example, if the PIN 1 is enabled and the user does not enter the code, the phone would not log onto the network, the phonebook cannot be accessed, etc. · PIN 2 is used to access additional options offered by the carrier or service provider. For example, fixed dial, call charges. Optus supports PIN 2 as well as fixed dial and call charges. Vodafone supports PIN 2 but only call charges. Telstra does not support any PIN 2 feature. To activate/deactivate, the user must go to the security menu (which differs from each model). G350 and G400 Press "F" button followed by "0" and "3". Enter Pin code followed by "M+" or "#" key. G500 Press "F" button followed by "0" and "3". Enter Pin code followed by "OK" or "#" key. G450/G520/G600/GD70 Press "Menu" button followed by "6" and "3" 'Enable PIN?' or 'Disable PIN?' will appear. Press "Menu" button. Enter Pin code followed by "Menu" button or "#" key.</P>
