<B><I>How many devices can I pair to the Supertooth II?</I></B></FONT>
<FONT FACE=ARIAL SIZE=2 COLOR=NAVY BLUE>
<P>The Supertooth can store pairing information for 2 different devices and connect to either when requested depending on which is in range and which was connected last. The Supertooth can only connect to one phone at a time. To connect to the second phone the first must be disconnected.</P>
<FONT FACE=ARIAL SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>
<B><I>Is my phone compatible?</I></B></FONT>
<P>If your phone has Bluetooth it more than likely supports a Handsfree or Headset Bluetooth profile, and so will work with the Supertooth II. Check your phones manual or our compatibility list on the BlueAnt website for up to date information.</P>
<FONT FACE=ARIAL SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>
<B><I> What is the passcode/passkey of the Supertooth II?</I></B></FONT>
<P>The Passcode for the Supertooth II is “0000”</P>
<FONT FACE=ARIAL SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>
<B><I>Do I need to pair the devices every time I use them together?</I></B></FONT>
<P>No, the pairing process is required only once for each phone. If you pair more than two phones the first will be deleted and pairing will need to be done again.</P>
