<FONT COLOR=GREEN><B>Determining if Your Logitech® Product Needs Warranty Replacement</B>
</FONT>
<FONT FACE=ARIAL SIZE=2>
<FONT COLOR=NAVY BLUE><P>Often times, a device may appear to be defective when it is not. This document provides information on determining if a device is defective and gives some guidelines for obtaining an RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization) Number if it is defective. This document should be used in conjunction with the product manual, which details the warranty information for your Logitech product. 
Please note this document contains general principles that apply to ALL Logitech products. Where a distinction is necessary, the product line is noted.</P>

<FONT COLOR=GREEN><B>Verify the Connections</B></FONT>
 
<P>Aside from making sure the device is plugged in, make sure the device is plugged into a port that the device supports. For example, some Logitech mice do not function on a serial port and cannot be adapted. Some gaming devices can only be plugged into the game port and can't be adapted to the USB port. If you are unsure what port your device connects to, the system requirements, including the supported connections, are listed on the product box.
</P><P>If you are using an adaptor to connect the device to a port that is not supported by the product hardware, remove the adaptor and connect it to the proper port. If you do not have an available port required by the product, you may wish to consider exchanging the device for a different model through your point of purchase.</P> 

<FONT COLOR=GREEN><B>Try it on Another System</b></FONT> 
<P>The next important step in determining if a device is defective is to test it on another system. For some products, you do not need to load any Logitech software. Some gaming devices are analog and do not require additional drivers for functionality. Logitech mice and keyboards do not require the packaged software for basic functionality; the native operating system drivers are enough to determine basic functionality. 
</P><P>There are a couple exceptions to this. The QuickCam® line of cameras and any digital gaming device require the installation of Logitech drivers. Also, if the feature you are trying to test is not supported by native OS drivers, you must load the software. Examples of this would be:</P> 
<UL>
<LI>	The scroll wheel of a mouse used on a Windows 95 system 
<LI>	A mouse or digital gaming device button assignment 
<LI>	On-screen feedback of the iTouch software 
</UL>
<P>NOTE:  If the problem you are experiencing is an intermittent problem, use your Logitech product on the test system for an extended period of time.</P>  
<P>If the product does not work on another system, it is likely defective.  Please proceed to the next section for information on obtaining an RMA number. However, if the product functions on another system, it is a system specific problem. In these cases it is highly recommended you obtain the Standard Diagnostics document associated with your device. You can find these standard diagnostics by clicking on your product from the Logitech Support home page. 
Using the resources on the Customer Support web site can resolve approximately 80% of issues that are experienced.</P> 

<FONT COLOR=GREEN><B>Cordless Devices</B></FONT> 
<P>Under most conditions, if a product fails on another system, it is usually defective. However, with cordless products this is not always the case. Other environmental variables will affect the performance of cordless devices, such as battery life, interference, failure to connect the emitter to the receiver correctly, inserting the batteries incorrectly, etc. When testing a cordless device for failure, it is important that you test with a fresh set of batteries. After inserting the batteries according to the instructions, you must re-synchronize the emitter (pointing device or keyboard) to the receiver. If you are using our current cordless products, just press the "Connect" button on the receiver then press the connect button on the bottom of the mouse/keyboard. If you are using a Cordless desktop system, you must do this procedure for both the mouse and the keyboard. If you are using any of our older cordless products, please refer to <A HREF=http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm?countryid=1&languageid=1&page=support/products/document&contentid=4549&CRID=322> Customer Support Document</A> "Synchronization Procedures for all Logitech Cordless Mice".</P> 
<P>When testing a cordless device, it is important to note that performance can be affected by other electrical devices in the area of the receiver, such as Zip drives, monitors, metal desks or desks lined with metal. In these cases, try moving the receiver at least 8 inches (21 cm) away from other electrical devices. You can also resolve interference issues by moving the mouse closer to the receiver. You may also want to experiment with different locations and positions for the receiver, including moving the receiver to an upright/vertical position or rotated to a different angle. Another alternate solution is to elevate the receiver by placing it on a CD ROM case or other item. More information on cordless products can be found in <A HREF=http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm?countryid=1&languageid=1&page=support/products/document&contentid=4549&CRID=322> Customer Support Document</A>  "Frequently Asked Questions on Logitech Cordless Devices". This document addresses common issues regarding Logitech Cordless products, including range and interference issues.</P> 

<FONT COLOR=GREEN><B>Tracking Issues with Pointing Devices</B></FONT> 
<P>If the problem you are trying to test is erratic tracking of a pointing device, make sure the device is clean. This only applies to mechanical mice and trackballs; optical mice and trackballs do not need to be cleaned. Instructions for cleaning trackballs, including regular maintenance tips for optical trackballs, are included in "TrackMan Cleaning Instructions". If you are using a corded mechanical mouse, remove the belly door, then remove the ball. Examine the rollers for any debris; a thin line running down the middle is generally an indication there is debris that needs removing Using a cotton swab lightly moistened with rubbing alcohol, gently scrape off any debris on the rollers. Replace the ball and the belly door. Test the tracking again.</P> 
<P>If you are using an optical mouse and experience erratic tracking, try using a mousepad or a different surface. Certain surfaces, such as wood with veins running through it or reflective surfaces like glass, can cause erratic tracking.</P> 

<FONT COLOR=GREEN><B>Obtaining an RMA number</B></FONT>
<P>To exchange or return your product within the first 30 days (US and Canada), we recommend returning it to the point of purchase. In order to exchange or return your product directly through Logitech, you must first contact <A HREF=http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/utilities/contact/AU/EN> Customer Support</A>  to obtain a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) number. If the product is still within warranty, Customer Support will give you an RMA number and a special address for the exchange or return.  You will be given RMA instructions when an RMA number is issued. Products sent to the Corporate address without an RMA number will NOT be processed, which underscores the importance of obtaining an RMA number from Logitech Support. If you have gone through the steps listed in this document and have found your product to be defective, please contact your nearest Logitech Customer Support center. A technician will need a detailed description of the steps you have followed to determine that the product is defective. You will also need the product information, such as M/N, P/N and S/N. Because of the nature of creating an RMA number, Logitech DOES NOT issue RMA numbers over the web; you MUST call your local support center.</P>
