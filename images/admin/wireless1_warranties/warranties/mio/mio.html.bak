<P>In some specific cases, Windows Mobile device connectivity to a Windows PC running Microsoft ActiveSync 4.0 may experience connection problems. It is likely caused by interoperability with desktop firewall applications or applications that manage network traffic. These applications appear to conflict with the TCP traffic between a Device and the PC.</P>

<B><I> I want to install a program on my Mio PDA but an error message "set up failure" appears on the screen. What could be wrong? </I></B>
</FONT>
 <P>Possible reasons:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Your storage card does not have enough memory.   Please delete some of your personal data or programs on it.   
<LI>The device is running a program at the moment, please cancel the installation.

<B><I> I cannot receive GPS signals. Why? </I> </B>
</FONT>
<P>For initial positioning, make sure that you remain at the same spot with a clear view of the sky. The GPS may take about 20 minutes to find its current location initially. A minimum of 4 GPS satellite signals is needed to determine current GPS position. Signal reception can be affected by situations such as bad weather or dense overhead obstacles (e.g. trees, tall buildings or even reflective car tint window). Therefore, when you are inside a tunnel or building, GPS positioning is not available.</P>
