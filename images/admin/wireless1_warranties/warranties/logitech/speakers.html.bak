<P>If you're using any speaker system that is NOT the Z-680 or Z-5500, please try the following:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Check the connections. Make sure the cable connected to the "Audio In" jack on the speakers is connected to the "Speaker Out" or "Line Out" jack on the sound card. You can test the sound card "Speaker Out" or "Line Out" jack to see if it is working correctly by connecting headphones to it.

<LI>Try connecting the speakers to a portable sound device such as a walkman or portable CD player. Plug the speakers into the headphone jack, but make sure the volume is lowered so the speakers are not over powered.

<LI>Check the system Volume Control located in the System tray. Make sure that the volumes are at a reasonable level and are not checked for Muting.

<I>How do I wall mount the satellites of my Logitech speakers?</I>
<BR><BR>
  	<B>Answer</B>
  	</FONT>

<P>If you own a Z-2200, Z-540, Z-640, Z-560, or Z-680:</P>
<P>Use the appropriate Allen key to remove the stand from the satellite. Then reverse the stand so that the bottom of the stand faces the wall. Re-attach the stand to the satellite. You'll then need to mount the satellites to the wall by using the appropriate size screws. There are holes located in the stand for you to hang the satellites on the screws.</P>

<P>If you own a Z-5500, Z-5300, X-620, X-530, or X-230:</P>
<P>DO NOT remove the stand from the satellite. If you do, you can no longer attach the satellite to the stand. Instead, hold the satellite with the bottom of the stand facing you and rotate the stand half a turn. (The direction which you rotate the stand is different depending on the speaker system. Do not force rotation, as the stand should easily rotate.) This should place the bottom of the stand facing the wall when mounting your speakers to the wall. Under the stands of the satellites, there are notches where you can hang your satellites to screws in the wall.</P>

Note: Use the appropriate screws/wall anchors for your type of wall. Not using the correct mounting screws can result in damage to your wall. Consult your local hardware store for the appropriate type of screw
