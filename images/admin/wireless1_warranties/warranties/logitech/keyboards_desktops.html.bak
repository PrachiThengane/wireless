<P>From time to time, the link between the mouse/keyboard and the receiver can be broken. This can be caused by dead batteries, putting in new batteries, moving the receiver from one computer to another, etc.</P>


<P>To resolve this situation, perform the following steps.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Make sure the receiver is properly connected and fresh batteries are installed in the mouse or keyboard. 
<LI>Press the Connect button on the receiver.
<LI>Press the Connect button on the receiver.
<LI>Press the Connect button on the keyboard.
</OL>
<P>If the above steps do not resolve the issue, it is possible that the device is not detected by Windows itself. Check the Device Manager to verify the devices are detected properly. (You may need a corded mouse or keyboard for this.) If you see yellow exclamation points or red X´s, click here for information on checking for hardware conflicts.</P>

<P>If the mouse works but the keyboard does not, or vice versa, perform the following steps:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Remove the batteries from the keyboard.
<LI>Make sure you have the mouse synchronized. To do this, press the connect button on the receiver, then press the connect button on the mouse.
<LI>Open the iTouch Configuration Panel by double clicking the iTouch icon in the Systray.
<LI>Click the Cordless tab.
<LI>Click the Connect button in the Control Panel. A dialog box will appear instructing you to press the connect button. Before you do, you should re-insert the batteries.
<LI>After inserting the batteries, press the connect button on the keyboard.
</OL>
<P>Verify both devices function correctly.</P>

<P>If this does not work, please try the steps below:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Remove the batteries from the keyboard and press keys on the keyboard repeatedly (as if typing) for approximately two minutes. This will clear out the capacitors.
<LI>Press the Connect button on the receiver.
<LI>Press the Connect button on the mouse. NOTE: You may need a pencil tip or other small tip to press the connect button.
<LI>Press the Connect button on the receiver.
<LI>Insert the batteries back into the keyboard.
<LI>Press the Connect button on the keyboard.
</OL>

<B>Question</B>
<BR><BR>  	
<I>What can cause interference with my cordless product, and what can I do?</I>
<BR><BR>
  	<B>Answer</B>
  	</FONT>
<BR>  	

<P>Any electrical device, such as the computer monitor, Zip drives, speakers, etc., can cause interference with Logitech cordless products. Most likely, this will effect tracking of pointing devices or the range of the device. Also, using Logitech cordless devices on a metal desk or a desk with a metal frame can cause problems with pointing device behavior and range. To resolve these types of issues, try moving the receiver at least 8 inches away from other electrical devices. Interference issues can also be resolved by moving the mouse closer to the receiver. You may also want to experiment with different locations and positions for the receiver, including moving the receiver to an upright/vertical position or rotated to a different angle. Another alternate solution is to elevate the receiver by placing it on a CD ROM case or other item.</P>
