<P>For specific instructions on connecting your Bluetooth headset with a particular phone, please visit our Bluetooth Resource Center. Below is a general connection procedure for all Bluetooth phones.</P> 

<P>Before beginning, make sure that your phone is Bluetooth capable. Contact your phone manufacturer if you are unsure that your phone has Bluetooth. All phones will have slightly different connection procedures. However, they should follow the general connection procedure listed below.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Make sure your Bluetooth headset is charged and in Discoverable mode. To place your Bluetooth headset in Discoverable mode, ensure the Bluetooth headset is off (no flashing LED’s on headset) and hold down the multi-function button on the Bluetooth headset until the LED flashes red and blue, then release the multi-function button. This indicates that the Bluetooth headset is in Discoverable mode.
<LI>Turn on your Bluetooth phone and search for new devices. Normally, you can do this by accessing the Bluetooth menu on your phone. Your phone should indicate that it found the “Logitech HS01” device; this is the Logitech Bluetooth headset. Instruct your phone to connect to the headset.
<LI>Enter the pair code when prompted by your phone. The default pairing code for Logitech Bluetooth headsets is 0000. Your Bluetooth headset and phone should now be paired.
<LI>(On some phones.) Set the Bluetooth headset to “authorized.” This will instruct your phone to connect to the headset when the headset is on and in range of the phone. 
</OL>
<P>To use your headset with your phone, you will need to press the multi-function once after turning on the headset. This will tell the headset to connect with your phone.</P>

  	<I>I paired my Bluetooth headset to my phone, but the headset won’t connect. What could be the problem?</I>

<P>After turning on the headset, you’ll need to press the multi-function button again to connect the headset to your phone. If this does not work, try getting the latest firmware updates for your phone. You can get the latest firmware updates from your phone manufacturer.</P>

<P>If the headset still fails to connect, test the headset on a PC. It may be possible that you have a Single-profile headset. Contact Logitech support to get a Dual-profile headset.</P>
