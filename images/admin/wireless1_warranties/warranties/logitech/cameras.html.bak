<OL>
<LI>Click "Start," and then "Run."
<LI>Type "D:\Setup.exe" and press the Enter key, where D: is the drive designation of your CD-ROM.
<LI>Follow the on-screen instructions. 
</OL>
<P>After the computer reboots, the driver installation for the camera will start. Do not connect the camera until the setup prompts you to connect the camera cable to your computer.</P>

<P>While the driver installation progresses, remove the camera and camera base from the packaging and mount the camera on the camera base.</P>

When prompted, plug the camera into the USB port

<I>Troubleshooting USB issues when using a Logitech camera?</I>
<BR><BR>
<B>Answer</B>
</FONT>
<BR><BR>
<P>This document is intended to address USB issues, a term we use to describe any problem with the camera attributed to the type of USB chipset on the system. Such issues can be, but are not limited to, the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Camera displays a green, black or yellow image in the QuickCam® Software
<LI>Camera is not detected after rebooting or going to sleep, but once re-plugged, it works.
<LI>Camera works on another computer, but not the one you intend to use the camera on. 
</UL>

<P>Before beginning diagnostics, please make sure you are using the latest release of DirectX. You can download the latest release here.</P>

<P>Logitech QuickCam PC Video Cameras are designed to work on either Universal Host Controller Interface (UHCI) or Open Host Controller Interface (OHCI) implementations of the Universal Serial Bus standard. Intel® and VIA® host controllers mainly use the UHCI implementation, while most other manufacturers use the OHCI implementation. You can determine what type of chipset you are using by checking what is listed in Device Manager.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Click the "Start" button.
<LI>Click on "Settings", then "Control Panel".
<LI>In the Control Panel, double click on the "System" icon. Windows® 2000 users, click on the Hardware Tab.
<LI>Click on the "Device Manager" tab.
<LI>Click on the plus (+) sign next to "Universal serial bus controller". If this entry does not exist, please contact the system manufacturer for help in troubleshooting the USB port(s).
<LI>Verify the type of Host Controller that is listed.
