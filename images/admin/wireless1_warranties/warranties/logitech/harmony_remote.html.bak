 	<B>Question</B>
<BR><BR>  	
<I>How do I know what inputs my device has?</I>
<BR><BR>
  	<B>Answer</B>
</FONT>  	

<P>What we refer to as "Inputs" are also known as "Sources" or "Functions" of a device. Your device will have one or more inputs (e.g. Antenna, Video 1, Video 2, DVD/LD, etc). Each input allows your device to process sound and/or video and from a different device. To find the names of the inputs for your device, please try one or all of these suggestions:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Using the "Input", "Source" or "Function" button(s) on your device's original remote, switch though all of the inputs and note the name of the input that is shown on the device's screen or display.
<LI>Refer to the User Manual for your device to find the list of all available inputs.
<LI>Check the back of the device and make a note of the names of the inputs.
</OL>
