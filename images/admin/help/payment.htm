        </h4>
        <p>At Wireless 1, we are committed to providing a secure environment to 
          make your purchases safe and easy. We have implemented <a href="http://www.mastercard.com/au/merchant/en/security/what_can_do/SecureCode/index.html">Mastercard 
          Secure code</a> and <a href="http://www.visa-asia.com/ap/au/merchants/productstech/vbv_intro.shtml">Verified 
          by Visa</a> which Mastercard and Visa have introduced to make purchasing 
          products online, safer and secure for both the purchaser and the merchant. 
          These PIN's act in the same way as they do for an ATM or handy card. 
          They verify that the card belongs to you, and that you are making the 
          purchase. These are important steps in ensuring that your credit card 
          is not used for any unauthorised transactions.</p>
        <p>To find out more about Mastercard Secure code or Verified by Visa, 
          please follow the links. <a href="http://www.mastercard.com/au/merchant/en/security/what_can_do/SecureCode/index.html">Mastercard

        <p>You can still purchase from us should you not have a PIN for your card, 
          however we may call you to confirm your order and ask for further information, 
          such as a copy of your drivers' licence and credit card, to be faxed 
          or emailed to us to ensure that the order is authorised by you as the 
          card holder.</p>
