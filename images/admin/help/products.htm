          <li><a name="1">Can I see the products before purchasing?</a></li>
        </h4>
        <p>As we are an online store, we currently do not have the facilities 
          to arrange you to view the products before purchasing. Should you wish 
          to view a product before purchasing, you can visit on of our retail 
          stores and purchase directly in store or online.</p>
        <h4> 
          <li><a name="2">What is your price guarantee?</a></li>
        </h4>
        <p>We strive to have competitive prices, so should you find a product 
          at a lower price elsewhere, we will match or beat that price. To take 
          advantage of this guarantee, all we require is the proof of the price 
          from our competitor (online site or promotion) and they must be an Australian 
          Registered Company with an ABN.</p>
        <P>Unfortunately we can not offer the price if it falls below our cost 
          price. If we did this, then we wouldn't be in business bringing you 
          fantastic deals!</P>
        <h4> 
          <li><a name="3">Are your products brand new?</a></li>
        </h4>
        <p>Yes all of our products are brand new and come with full Tax Invoices.</p>
        <h4> 
          <li><a name="4">Are your products genuine?</a></li>
        </h4>
        <p>Yes they are, and most come with Manufacturers warranty. We sell no 
          imitations at Wireless 1!</p>
        <h4> 
          <li><a name="5">What if the Product is unavailable?</a></li>
        </h4>
        <p>We endeavour to ensure all products are in stock at the time they are 
          advertised, however in some cases beyond our control, this may not be 
          possible, for example manufacturer shortages or damaged stock in transit. 
          In these rare cases, we will contact you immediately and solve the issue 
          for you. </p>
        <h4> 
          <li><a name="6">Can you order me in a product which is not on your website?</a></li>
        </h4>
        <p>We will endeavour to order a product if we do not have it within a 
          product range. This will depend on our suppliers and prices, however 
          is there is a product you would like to order, let us know and will 
          try our best to get it for you!</p>
