        <p>If the item you receive has been damaged in transit, please contact

        <p>If your item is DOA (Dead On Arrival), please contact us within 1 business 
          day of receiving the item and we will arrange a RA (Return Authorisation) 
          Number so the item can be returned. DOA items are sent to the manufacturer

          for DOA items. </p>

        </h4>
        <p>Manufacturer or supplier warranty applies to all products sold by Wireless 
          1. Please consult your warranty card with your item for details on having 
          your item repaired/replaced under warranty. If you require warranty 
          information, you can also visit our <a href="http://www.wireless1.com.au/Warranty.aspx">Warranty 
          Pages</a> for all manufacturer contact details.</P>
        <p>If the manufacturer directs you to return the item to us, please contact 
          us with your order number or invoice number and we will issue you with 
          an RA (Return Authorisation) Number.</p>
        <p>Once your item has been received, it will be forwarded to the manufacturer 
          or supplier under their warranty conditions. Unfortunately Wireless 
          1 has no control over warranty turnaround times, however we will endeavour 
          to follow up your warranty item to ensure it is completed as fast as 
          possible for you. Should you require any information regarding an item 
          you have sent to us under warranty, please contact us with the RA number 
          that we have supplied you.</p>
        <p>If returning a faulty item to us as directed by the manufacturer, please 
          return it in the original packaging with all contents and accessories.</p>
        <h4> 
          <li><a name="3">Returns and Refunds </a></li>
        </h4>
        <p>We endeavour to have all DOA and faulty items replaced for you, however 
          should you wish to have the item refunded, this is possible. Refunds 
          are possible only when an item has been deemed faulty by the manufacturer/supplier 
          and Wireless 1 has been credited for this. A refund can only be processed 
          if all contents and accessories have also been returned with the item.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately we do not refund for incompatibility, so please choose 
          carefully.</p>
        <p>Any item which is returned to us being DOA, Faulty or damaged is done 
          so at the expense of the buyer.</p>
