    <td width="33%" valign="top"><p class="style8">Flexirent is a sensible way to pay  for technology such as computers, office equipment, digital cameras and  IT equipment. You can spread the cost of equipment over its useful  life, yet it is flexible enough to allow you to upgrade to new  equipment at any time. (Conditions apply). In addition to being covered  by a Complete Protection Package, Flexirenting offers many other  advantages. </p>
      <p class="style8">During the Christmas/New Year period, Wireless 1 is offering customers a great Flexirent deal. Purchase a complete notebook solution from us (including extended warranty, internet security software and surge protector) for $1500 or more between 11th November and 31st December 2008 (inclusive) and choose from one of the great bonuses to the right:</p>
      <p align="left" class="style8">You simply pay the first monthâ€™s rental, then take the equipment away. This allows you to conserve your vital working capital.</p>
      <p align="left" class="style8">To keep using the  old equipment after the end of the rental term, you just make one  additional payment at the end (equal to a normal monthly payment) and  you will double the original rental period, with no more to pay.</p></td>
