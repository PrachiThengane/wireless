    <td width="50%" valign="top"><p><span class="style2"><span class="style3"><strong>Selectable</strong> dual band routers work in <u>either</u> the 2.4 <u>or</u> 5 gigahertz radio bands—but not at the same time</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="style2"><span class="style3"><strong>Hybrid</strong> dual band routers work with “standard” Wireless-G in one radio band and faster Wireless-N in the other radio band</span></span></p>
      <p class="style1">The Linksys by Cisco WRT610N works <strong>simultaneously</strong> with Wireless-N in <u>both</u> the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz radio bands, doubling network capacity</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="small.jpg" alt="router" width="229" height="111" /></p>
      <p class="style1">This means you get twice the bandwidth for smooth high-definition video, lag  free gaming, and uninterrupted music in one band, while browsing the  Internet, sharing files, sending e-mail, and printing in the other.  Wireless-N gives you incredible range and speed in both bands, while  Linksys' Entertainment Optimized Networking (EON) technology  prioritizes network traffic so that time-sensitive applications like HD  video stream smoothly. </p>    </td>
    <td width="50%" valign="top"><p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="style1">The Storage Link feature lets you connect a hard drive or flash-based  USB storage device directly to your network to easily add gigabytes of  storage. Access your music, video, or data files from any PC within  your network, or through the Internet. The 4 built-in Gigabit ports  provide far faster connections to your wired devices than standard  Ethernet ports.</p>
    <p class="style1">Setup is designed to be quick and easy with the PC or Mac compatible  Setup Wizard. And Wi-Fi Protected Setup™ can help make secure wireless  connections with the press of a button. Use the included Linksys  EasyLink Advisor (LELA) program as your personal technology expert to  help manage and optimize your network as it grows.</p>
    <p class="style1">A Setup Wizard guides quick installation for Windows XP, Windows Vista  and Macintosh OS X operating systems. The Dual-N Bands are designed to  stream uninterrupted video from an Apple TV or Windows Media Center to  your home theater or HDTV.</p></td>
