Traditional file servers can take hours to configure and, even once up and running, don&rsquo;t have built-in system monitoring and email alerts. Automatic alerts give you the peace of mind that things are running smoothly because if trouble should arise, you will be notified.RAIDSupporting hardware accelerated RAID (redundant array of independent disks) levels 0, 1, 5 and ReadyNAS&rsquo;s own X-RAID2&trade; technology, the NV+ v2 ensures full data redundancy with protection against hardware failure &ndash; something previously only available in high-end servers. If one drive fails, the data volumes can still be rebuilt with the remaining drives. Without RAID, once a failure occurs, you risk losing all of the data stored on the drive.X-RAID2 TechnologyReadyNAS&rsquo;s patent pending X-RAID2 technology automates the volume expansion for you as you scale from 1 drive to 4 drives. Most NAS devices on the market aren&rsquo;t future-proof. You can&rsquo;t add or replace disks for larger capacity. ReadyNAS allows you to start with one disk, then add the additional drives over time, without reconfiguring the system and shuffling the data. Additionally, as disk capacity becomes larger and cheaper, you can replace all four disks, one by one, while X-RAID2 automatically manages the RAID details for you.BackupAll ReadyNAS systems include multiple backup layers that you can customize to fit your needs. First, protect Windows and Mac clients with our included CDP software. Then, take a snapshot of your ReadyNAS data to ensure a recovery point. Next, backup to a USB drive on demand or on a schedule. Replication is a cinch between two ReadyNAS systems, and finally the ReadyNAS Vault option can move files and folders to an offsite secure data center for disaster recovery. It&rsquo;s all built in!File Serving and Media StreamingReadyNAS is a single centralized source for all of your digital data. The variety of digital devices and hard drives that currently house the data in your home and office can make locating a particular file quite arduous. ReadyNAS can bring all of that data together for fast and easy file serving to multiple clients simultaneously. If it's video or other high-definition media you are working with, you can use your ReadyNAS for streaming to multiple devices at the same time. ReadyNAS also provides DLNA Certified media streaming to a wide variety of digital media devices (such as NETGEAR EVA products or Microsoft Xbox 360&trade;).Advanced System DesignThe industrial design and ultra compact form factor of the ReadyNAS makes it perfect for any home office or small business. Standing only eight inches tall and five inches wide, it can fit in any entertainment center or on any desk without taking up much space or making much noise.

Its high contrast ratio results in blacker blacks and whiter whites. And everything in between is rich and vibrant.

And you&rsquo;re going to love what you see.Long-lasting batteryThe 15‑inch MacBook&nbsp;Pro now lasts up to 8 hours between charges. That&rsquo;s impressive battery life for any notebook.

Since these MacBook&nbsp;Pro models come with up to 1TB of flash storage, you can keep all your important files with you.4&nbsp;Flash doesn&rsquo;t have any moving parts, which makes it superdurable and quiet.

That&rsquo;s because we labored painstakingly over the design to maximize the quality of every decibel you hear.Dual built-in microphones are great for when you want to be heard. If you&rsquo;re making a FaceTime call, for example, the mics reduce background noise from behind the notebook.

And they&rsquo;ll do the same for everything you create with it.Retina DisplayWhen you pack so many pixels into a display &mdash; over 4&nbsp;million on the 13‑inch model and over 5 million on the 15‑inch model &mdash; the results are positively stunning. The pixel density is so high, your eyes can&rsquo;t discern individual pixels. Images take on a new level of realism. A spectacular 2560-by-1600 resolution on the 13‑inch MacBook&nbsp;Pro and an equally impressive 2880-by-1800 resolution on the 15‑inch MacBook&nbsp;Pro let you see more of your high-resolution images with pixel-for-pixel accuracy. And text is so sharp, you&rsquo;ll feel like you&rsquo;re reading email, web pages, and documents on a printed page.The Retina display reduces glare while maintaining incredible color and quality. Its high contrast ratio results in blacker blacks and whiter whites. And everything in between is rich and vibrant. IPS technology gives you a wide, 178-degree view of everything on the screen, so you&rsquo;ll see the difference at practically any angle. And you&rsquo;re going to love what you see.Long-lasting batteryThe 13‑inch MacBook&nbsp;Pro now lasts up to 9 hours between charges. That&rsquo;s impressive battery life for any notebook. But for a high-performance notebook with an ultra-high-resolution display, state-of-the-art processors and graphics, and a superslim design, it&rsquo;s absolutely remarkable. The built-in battery gives you up to 1000 full charge and discharge cycles and up to 30 days of instant-on standby time.2Faster all flash storageYou&rsquo;ll notice a difference in whatever you do &mdash; starting up takes seconds, apps launch quickly, even navigating the desktop feels incredibly fluid and responsive. It&rsquo;s all thanks to the new PCle-based flash storage with even faster read and write performance &mdash; up to 60 percent faster than the previous-generation MacBook&nbsp;Pro.3&nbsp;So you can import huge photo libraries into Aperture in no time flat. And on the 15‑inch model, flash storage combines with quad-core processors and high-performance graphics to make quick work of even the most demanding editing tasks in Final Cut Pro. Since these MacBook&nbsp;Pro models come with up to 1TB of flash storage, you can keep all your important files with you.4&nbsp;Flash doesn&rsquo;t have any moving parts, which makes it superdurable and quiet. And flash storage is extremely energy efficient, which means your MacBook&nbsp;Pro also has the ability to stay in standby mode for up to a month, without plugging in. So whether it&rsquo;s been 1 day or 30, your all-flash MacBook&nbsp;Pro will spring to life, right where you left off.802.11ac Wi-FiMeet the ultimate mobile creative studio. With an emphasis on mobile. Equipped with the latest 802.11ac Wi‑Fi and Bluetooth 4.0 wireless technology, you&rsquo;re free to unplug and still stay connected &mdash; to your network, to your wireless peripherals, and to the world. With AirPlay and Apple&nbsp;TV, you can wirelessly play video, show off photos, and enjoy music from your MacBook&nbsp;Pro on your widescreen TV. And when your MacBook&nbsp;Pro connects to an 802.11ac Wi‑Fi base station, such as AirPort Extreme or AirPort Time Capsule, your wireless performance is up to 3x faster.Audio and visualYou haven&rsquo;t heard it all until you&rsquo;ve heard the speakers inside MacBook&nbsp;Pro. For something so thin and light, the sound is huge. And with a wide dynamic range, optimal balance, and a crisp, expressive quality, these speakers might sound too good to be true. That&rsquo;s because we labored painstakingly over the design to maximize the quality of every decibel you hear.Dual built-in microphones are great for when you want to be heard. If you&rsquo;re making a FaceTime call, for example, the mics reduce background noise from behind the notebook. And when you use Dictation, they create an adaptive audio beam that intelligently adjusts to detect your voice &mdash; instead of the noise around you.","1,595.00",Yes,New,http://www.wireless1.com.au/laptops/laptop-type/apple-me864x-a-13inch-macbook-pro-retina-128gb,http://www.wireless1.com.au/media/catalog/product/a/p/apple_mac_pro_13inch_1__1.jpg,"MacBook Pro",

The Reality Display is powered by Mobile BRAVIA&reg; Engine 2. That means razor sharp images, vibrant colours and the enhanced contrast you recognize from Sony TVs.One-touch functionsUse your smartphone to create living room get-togethers. This NFC Android smartphone lets you share photos, films and games on your HDTV with One-touch mirroring.

It will notify you of everything from incoming calls and text messages to Facebook notifications. And when listening to music, the illumination will pulse to the beat, becoming more intense as you crank up the volume.Letting design take the leadThe Xperia SP was born out of a simple paper mockup and a strong vision of creating something truly unique. Our designers Jessie Zhao and Toshihide Umedan had a clear idea of crafting a smartphone where the display virtually floats in thin air. To be able to achieve this, we paired their design vision with our 60 years of Sony engineering experience. We created a transparent antenna and a body that was solid while retaining a floating feel. Then we focused on getting the right weight and shape &ndash; since balance and proportion is crucial for the overall user experience. Finally we chose the colours black, white and red, which complement the metal structure as well as the quality of each component.Lightning speed performance &ndash; Dual-core processorWe&rsquo;ve matched the latest Sony software with the powerful Qualcomm&reg; Snapdragon&trade; S4 Pro processor. This dual core processor gives your HD phone top performance and speed without draining your battery &ndash; run multiple apps simultaneously, surf the web with no loading time, and stream videos without a break.

Once connected, you can watch live video from any of your cameras, or playback recorded footage with the intuitive on-screen controls. With no set up fees or subscription costs, home and business users have the most flexible way to ensure their properties are secure.The easiest way to home monitoringWith the mydlink&trade; Network Video Recorder it has never been easier to create a complete monitoring system for your home or small business. Unlike other solutions that require users to change their network settings to access their NVR from the Internet, the DNR-322L is simple to manage and access. Simply run the installation CD, assign your NVR to your mydlink&trade; account or if you are a first time user, set one up, and you are ready to go. The DNR-322L will even automatically discover your D-Link cameras in your network for you.A complete and flexible security solutionThe DNR-322L is the perfect solution for small businesses or people that travel and need to leave their properties unattended for long periods of time. With 2 bays for standard 3.5 inch, inexpensive Hard Drives, you can choose the recording capacity that best suits your needs. For example, two 3TB hard drives can store high-quality audio and video from four DCS-942L cameras for up to 6 weeks. The DNR-322L can be set up to record only during certain periods of time (for example, at night or during the weekends), or based on events, like on motion detection, so the recording capacity can be extended much longer.Versatile MonitoringUsers have a variety of options for viewing and organising camera footage on-screen. If multiple cameras have been set up in a property, users can simply drag and drop video from selected cameras to the viewing area. Camera names and recording statuses are clearly displayed for easy reference. Users can control pan/tilt/zoom (PTZ) functions from within the interface or by directly clicking on the video.&emsp;Secure StorageUser accounts can be set up to limit access to the NVR or assign different access privileges for users by specifying the cameras they are allowed to access. For added security (for example to protect business premises) the recorded footage can be backed up to external storage on a different location. The NVR also includes the option to protect data using a RAID 1 configuration, which duplicates recorded video onto two separate hard drives. So your video is safe even if one of the Hard Drives fails.Extensive Recording FunctionalityThe mydlink&trade; Network Video Recorder&rsquo;s interface allows for straightforward configuration including compression, resolution, and frame rate for all connected cameras. Once the cameras have been set up, recordings can be made continuously, or according to a user-defined schedule. The NVR also provides event recording based on specific triggers such as when motion is detected.D-Link Green&trade;The Network Video Recorder with mydlink&trade; is part of D-Link Green&trade;, D-Link&rsquo;s programme for providing eco-friendly alternatives without compromising performance: if the Hard Drives are not used in a configurable period of time, or data is not being transmitted, the DNR-322L will enter stand-by mode to save power. Also, the silent fan will adapt its speed depending on the Hard Drives&rsquo; temperature.",199.00,Yes,New,http://www.wireless1.com.au/networking/networking-products/d-link-dnr-322l,http://www.wireless1.com.au/media/catalog/product/d/n/dnr-322l_1__1.jpg,"Security Cameras",

ASUH100TA-DK004H_RFB,Asus,"Asus H100TA-DK004H Refurbished Laptop","The Ultraportable TransformedTransformer Book H100TA is a compact ultraportable that combines the productivity features of a laptop with the easy portability of a tablet &mdash; and you can switch between the two in an instant. At just 1.07kg, H100TA is one of the lightest laptops around, but detach the 10.1-inch display from the keyboard and it becomes an equally lightweight multi-touch tablet you can take anywhere. The sleek design features a durable finish, too, so H100TA will always look its best.High-performance&nbsp;productivityTransformer Book H100TA is powered by the latest Intel&reg; Atom&trade; Z3740 quad-core processor for perfect balance of multi-tasking performance and outstanding energy efficiency. With up to 11 hours battery life, H100TA can last for more than a full working day before it needs to be rechargedyour productivity will know no bounds. 32 / 64GB eMMC storage makes launching apps and saving files speedy, too, while USB 3.0 supports next-generation SuperSpeed storage devices for turbo-charged data transfers.Stay unplugged for longerTransformer Book H100TA lasts for up to 11 hours on battery power and, with exclusive ASUS Super Hybrid Engine II technology, you can enjoy extended standby times of up to two weeks with near-instant wake-up times. Just press the power button and H100TA is ready for use in just two seconds, so there&rsquo;s no waiting around when it&rsquo;s time to work &mdash; or play. There&rsquo;s no need to worry about data loss if H100TA is left unused for longer, either. Data is also backed up automatically when the battery level drops to 5% in standby mode, so you won&rsquo;t be in for a nasty surprise when you next switch on.The dock that rocksTransformer Book H100TA isn&rsquo;t just a tablet with a keyboard dock &mdash; it&rsquo;s designed from the get-go to be a fully functional laptop. Precision-engineered keys with ample travel make for comfortable typing and the multi-touch touchpad complements the multi-touch display with full Windows 8.1 gesture support. The dock also features USB 3.0 with full support for next-generation high-speed storage devices, while a Micro-HDMI port on tablet means you can connect H100TA to a Full HD TV for big-screen entertainment.Serious sound qualityDeveloped by the team of experts in the ASUS Golden Ear team, SonicMaster audio technology uses a tailored mix of hardware and software to enhance sound quality to a level far above what you might expect from so small a laptop. Stereo speakers with large resonance chambers give rich, rounded bass and sophisticated audio processing tools boost the frequency range to make music, movies and games sound fantastic.A screen that's easy on the eyesTaking a tablet to bed is one way to catch up on some reading, but it&rsquo;s not always advisable. Bright light can dazzle in a dark environment and the high-energy visible light emitted by traditional computer displays has been linked to age-related macular degeneration. Transformer Book H100TA features a special &lsquo;reading mode&rsquo; to help avoid this.

You can also monitor activity on your home network, add new devices, and check upload and download speeds. In addition, Linksys SMART Wi-Fi allows you to prioritize which devices on your network receive the most bandwidth to reduce lag times and buffering when you're streaming HD media or gaming. Your Linksys Smart Wi-Fi account also gives you access to apps that provide additional ways to control and interact with your home Wi-Fi network.WRT1900AC is the first Linksys router to incorporate the Network Map tool in SMART Wi-Fi when using your SMART Wi-Fi account. Network Map provides a visual overview of your network allowing you to see all devices on your network, their online status and signal strength, and also measure how much bandwidth they're using at any time. It also allows you to create personalized identifiable names so that you can identify your connected devices.Open Source ReadyWhile the Linksys WRT1900AC provides an outstanding experience via SMART Wi-Fi immediately out of the box, advanced users can further modify the router, which will have Open Source firmware available.
